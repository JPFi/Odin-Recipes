        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>After starting my fitness journey back in 2021, I decided to share my success with fitness, as well as my failures
            during a process that requires a lot of resiliency, discipline and dedication. 

        <p>Discovering the success and the failures allows me to provide you with the utmost crucial advice in fitness, and that is that 
            <em><strong>nutrition is 90% of your journey</strong></em>.</p>  

        <p>So, <strong>nutrition</strong>. Let me help you with just that.</p>
