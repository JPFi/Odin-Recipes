        <h2>Step By Step Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Texture ensures quality. Start by grabbing a pan and adding 3-4 cups of water, let it boil
                for approximately 10-15 minutes on medium heat, 5-10 minutes on high heat.</li>
            <li>Next, we move on to cooking the ground turkey on a regular pan. Luckily, ground turkey
            can be cooked without additional spices, however, for that essentric taste, use regular seasoning and sprinkle
            a few hints of black pepper while the pan is heating on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Your third, and final pan will be used to mix in the ingredients for the sauce. Once your pan is heated,
            <em>(for multiple servings)</em> empty a can of tomato sauce and let the sauce simmer for a few minutes.
            <strong>You may add a cup of water to ensure the tomato sauce does not dry up in the process.</strong></li>
            <li>Once the sauce is rich in texture, apply a handful of the fat-free mozzarella chesse to merge the flavors together.</li>
            <li>Apply a tiny spoon scoup of the pesto sauce, let it simmer for a few minutes and add some baby spinach on the pan.
            Give it a good 2-3 minute mix to ensure the sauce is mixed in together.</li>
            <li><em>Now the fun part begins</em>. Once your pasta is well-boiled, dump it into the sauce and give it a good mix. You'll notice
            a drastic change in color and the flavors really mixing well together.</li>
            <li>Finally, throw your well-seasoned ground turkey into the pan and mix it all in to absorb the full texture of the protein-rich recipe.</li>
        </ul>
