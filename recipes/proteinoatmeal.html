            <li>Almond Butter-<strong>$7.39</strong></li>

        <h3>Step By Step Process</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by filling a pan with water <em>(2-3 cups of water into the pan)</em> and start boiling at medium heat
                for 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the water begins to steam, add 1-2 full cups of old-fashioned oats to cook slowly and grab the following
                ingredients:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Strawberries</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
                <li>Almond Butter</li>
                <li>Whey Protein</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you've grabbed your <em>tasty</em> ingredients, start adding a tablespoon of almond butter <strong> (only if you notice
            that the oats are soft and cooked)</strong> and mix the butter in to extend the flavor throughout the oats.</li>
            <li>After a good mix <em> (30 seconds-minute)</em>, slice half to a full banana along with slices of strawberries
                into the mix to really complement the flavors together.</li>
            <li>Once mixed, add your fully-cooked oats onto a bowl and add a <strong> scoop or 2 of whey protein</strong> into the bowl and mix.
            Oats are carbs low in calories, adding in your almond butter + the scoop of protein will add more calories to your oats while simultaneously 
            reducing the risk of gaining extra body fat.</li>
            <li>Next, add in your greek yogurt and mix. Your oats turn from bland to grand instantly.</li>
            <li>Finally, add your sugar-free chocolate chips and honey and enjoy nearly <em> (600)</em> calories per serving.</li>        
        </ul>

        <p><em>Bonus tip</em>: For even sweeter flavor, Chobani's vanilla-flavored greek yogurt adds an incredible taste to your oats.</p>
