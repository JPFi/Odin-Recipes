        <p>This is a fun one, and my personal go-to on mornings where I'm having a very long training 
            session. You want to ensure your body is provided with the necessary fuel to explode in your
            upcoming workouts. Visit this <a href="https://amoderntomorrow.com/?p=30">powerful</a> article 
            for a look at some of my most insightful tips on keeping track with your fitness goals. This helps me provide additional
            content for others; I appreciate you taking time out of your day to read my blog.</p>

        <p>Now that we've gotten the boring items out of the <em>whey (pun intended)</em>, let's go over the
        the important ingredients to create this <em>really-important</em> recipe.</p>
        
        <p>For a list, you'll need the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Egg Whites-<strong>$4.99</strong> <em>(this is mostly for controlled weight loss and muscle gain, 
                otherwise you can use whole eggs, preferably brown for more calories)</em></li>
            <li>Baby Spinach pack-<strong>$2.59</strong></li>
            <li>Turkey Bacon-<strong>$3.99</strong></li>
            <li>Onions-<strong>$2.99</strong></li>
            <li>Mushrooms-<strong>$2.99</strong></li>
            <li>Tomatoes-<strong>$1.49</strong></li>
            <li>Black Pepper-<strong>$1.39</strong></li>
            <li>Fat-free Mozzarella Cheese-<strong>$3.99</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Obviously, for an omelette, you can create many combinations; I like to keep mine simple and easy to digest. You can 
        add other sources of protein as well, so long as they're low fat. <em>I'm an advocate for turkey bacon, 
        obviously.</em></p>

        <h3>Step By Step Process</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>On a frying pan, add some fat-free avocado or vegetable oil and let it simmer for 5-10 minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>I personally like to buy the spray oil as it heats up the pan quicker.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the pan is hot, add your: baby spinach, mushrooms, turkey bacon <em>(or protein of choice)</em>, sliced tomatoes
                and onions, let it cook for about 5-7 minutes. You want to ensure the ingredients are cooked evenly, so spread
                them out on the pan.</li>
            <li>Then, on a bowl, mix your egg whites <em>(white, or brown egg)</em> with your black pepper, and add it to your
                pan accordingly. Allow some time for the eggs to mix in well with the ingredients.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, flip back and forth to evenly cook the omelette.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, add your mozzarella cheese and cook on low-heat for 5 minutes. This will allow the cheese to dissolve
                for a <em>delicious</em> taste.</li>
            </li>            
        </ul>
